Description: MetShot will provides functions to schedule the high-throughput acquisition 
            of targeted tandem mass spectrometry. Targets can be prioritized by biological relevance, 
            e.g. determined by XCMS's diffreports, or user-provided priority lists. 
            Supported target formats for instrument control are the PSI
            traML, Bruker micrOTOF control methods and Agilent something. 
            After the measurements, MetShot uses CAMERA functions to create tandem mass peak
            list, to avoid background signals. Finally, MetShot can create batch query
            files for identification against MassBank or MetFrag.
